                          I've been keeping this in for a while, but I think today is the perfect time to say it—you’re the reason my days feel brighter. Every little moment with you means more than I can put into words. Your smile, your laughter, the way you make everything feel lighter—it all makes my heart race in the best way possible. Uhm, I hope you'll read everything I'm about to say.

                           So, here it is… I like you, a lot. This might not seem like the right timing to do this, I have something special I want to share to you. Today, the 29th, signifies a new month added to how many months I have liked you in total. Well, today makes it the 9th month. I'm going to be straightforward with this. You being nice, caring, joyful, and loving are the reasons why I've liked you in the first place. Well at first it was because you're pretty. But the more I got to know you, the more my feelings developed. I no longer liked you only from the surface level—but reaching beyond that, making me like you for just being you with your friends. For seeing positivity even in rough times. I love the way you care for people, for animals, and for all the things that are harmless to you. To us. We haven't interacted in person, but I just wanted to tell you how I feel for my own peace of mind. No pressure though, I'm not expecting you to reciprocate my feelings. No matter your answer, I 
                                    just wanted you to know how special you are to me. You’ve filled my heart with warmth in ways I never expected, and for that, I’m grateful. But no pressure. I made this to express what I've been feeling for you for my own peace of mind. I want to tell you how much I like you—to cherish you, to make you smile, and to remind you just how much you mean to me. You are so radiant. You make people around you feel happy as well. The poems I've sent you, it was all for you. The songs I've posted as my note on my dump account in Messenger, it was all for you. The "I like U" by NIKI that you replied to was supposedly meant for you. I was both happily laughing and upset while reading the reply you sent: "Ulrich" because of the "U". But when you asked me who the U is, I didn't mean as in the initial "U". I was referring to YOU. I was never really brave to confess this to you until now. Simple things you do to me and to other people makes me happy. Honestly, you make me happy everyday
                                    by just simply replying to my messages makes me so happy. During my birthday, the best birthday gift I had received was the greet you sent me at night. That was the day you and I started chatting again. It might not seem much, but it means the world to me. It's the simple things you do are one of the reasons why I've fallen for you. Okay, back to our awarding for MTAP. You tapped me in the shoulder telling me I'm pretty. I didn't respond, but I felt giddy inside.. I couldn't stop smiling despite me not believing the compliment you gave me. Why is that? Well, in my household, I'm not considered as pretty and is always compared to my older sister. I've received the same compliments from my friends who I see as my family, but yours was different. Coming from someone I didn't recognize at first hit me hard. Moving on, even though we don't interact in real life, even if I don't know you as much as others do, I really do like you. I have and will accept your imperfections. Like 
                                    you said, who am I to judge when I, myself, is also imperfect? I like you because you're being you. I can never thank you enough for not cutting me off that day on November 29th, 2024, the date I confessed my feelings for you for the first time. I conveyed my messsage just like that with no effort. When I recall that moment, even I get disappointed in myself. You probably think that the way you're treating me is just a friendly guesture. Yes, I think that way, too. Pero for me, I see it as something else. But of course I don't let it get to me. Also, thank you for always believing in me. You told me that as long as I try my best, it's alright no matter what the results will be. No one ever treated me that way. I've been a consistent academic achiever being pressured to do better. They didn't and they still don't believe in me. But you, you did. You told me I could do it. You told me to pass the exams before. I did. You became my motivation to strive forward. Your good deeds                                     made me feel seen, valued, loved in a way nobody else did to me. Aside from that, you also talked to me about God. Because of that, I now run to Him all the time. I pray for both your family and I's. You made me realize that God did not approve of my bad deeds, so I've changed. I'm slowly changing for the better, all thanks to you. Now, why'd I actually like you? Like I said, at first, it was only because my first impression of you was that you're pretty although I did think you were mean.. As I got to know you, the more it passed through just the surface. Everything you've said, I always take note of it. I pay attention to it. I love you for being nice, friendly, sweet, funny, caring, loving, pretty and cute, smart, family-oriented, for beig gentle and supportive to everyone, for having a good personality and for being a good person who sees not only the bad, but also the good. Thank you for having a bright and joyful presence. You're alluring. Special. Unique. You might 
                                    think I'm glazing, but trust me. If I asked them if they'd agree with me, they would. Again, I am not glazing. I never even expected myself to like you this much. I like you more than I like myself, honestly. I have to admit, I can't stop thinkin about you. I guess you've captured my thoughts. Me. My heart. Again, I like you, your flaws, your imperfections, your style, your worst, and most of all, your smile. I've already expected my feelings not to be reciprocated. Just a confession so I finally won't have to think about it all the time. I don't like keeping secrets from people I truly care for. I genuinely and sincerely like you, and I'd rather tell you this as many times possible and still getting rejected than regret not telling you. Either way, I have no chance because just as you told me, you tihnk you have affection for your uh new classmate. The girl! Even if it's not her but you still like someone else and talk to me about it, all I wish is for you to be happy even                                     if it means the opposite for me. Because like I said, seeing my friends happy makes me happy as well. I'm doing this out of my own will, okay? Not sending this to you today feels like a crime that I don't want to commit. You might not notice, but I've noticed myself change for the better all thanks to you. So, thanks for helping me shape myself the way I am now. Agaaain, I know I stand zero chance. I just wanted to tell you this! I wish for you to be happy all the time—to never lose that pretty smile of yours, and lastly, to never lose the goodness in you. This is so unorganized, because I uh want it to be really real, since it comes from my heart, there must be no corrections as well. This isn't much, but I hope you'll read this. c:
